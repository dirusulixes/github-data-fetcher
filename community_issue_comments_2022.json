A networking maintainer doesn't need to be an expert on all things \"networking\" in Istio -- and I don't any current maintainers are given the breadth of Istio. Part of the responsibilities of a maintainer is not just to approve PRs, but also know when _not_ to approve PRs. For example, if a Maintainer was a CNI pro but had no other expertise (which is not the case for Ben, IMO, just an example), I would simply expect them to not approve PRs outside of CNI.\r\n\r\nNote the \"pilot\" subgroup is a bit different scenario. That was about making a higher bar for a critical code portion. This CNI group discussion is more like a side-group, not sub-group. Generally our groups are all bucketed under WGs, though, which makes the not possible in GitHub. As noted above though, I don't think we need to anyways.",

I'm currently capturing comments (up to 30,000 per repository due to GitHub limitations), issues, pull request, commits, etc. so experimenting with different types of embedding models and chunking methods will be trivial.\r\n\r\nMy only concern right now is performance (not my indexing engine but rather the process of generating embeddings).

The goal is to get to a point where I can create agents/bots to answer questions and to perform tasks for maintainers, developers, team leads, etc.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion that I've come to is, in order to create a useful automated Q and A system, you'll need an easy way to do the following:\r\n\r\n1) Classify and clean data.\r\n2) Generate Q and A pairs.  \r\n3) Review and iterate on generated Q and A pairs\r\n\r\nThe part that I will be tackling in the near future is creating a system to classify and clean data, which is the most critical, since garbage in = garbage out.  Once you have clean data (with good metadata), generating Q and A pairs should be pretty straight forward as you can use LLMs to generate them. \r\n\r\nIf you have a system or thoughts on how to clean/organize the data, I'd be interested to hear them.  I'm currently planning on creating a system that will leverage LLM to help classify and prep data.\r\n",

There's no way to issue invites from Slack itself, so we have to generate these tokens which are valid for a few hundred users.  When those are all used up, we have to generate a new URL.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely working now!\r\n\r\nAs for questions and answers on Stack Overflow and Discuss, I do also see there's a lot of questions not being answered. That's a challenge when there are so many vendors.  One thing that we're going to try and do in the Steering committee this term is encourage our community to help answer user questions.   Developers are busy developing and don't tend to pay as much attention as they do early in the life of a project.\r\n\r\n(@howardjohn is excluded from this critique, as not only has he replied on this thread, but also replies to many Slack threads)",
